# Age_Gender_Detection
Age and Gender detection using OpenCV

Age assessment is a multi-class issue in which the years; are categorized into classes. Individuals of various ages
have various facials, so it is hard to assemble the pictures. The areas of classification by age and sex have been
studied for decades. Various approaches have been taken over the years to tackle this problem, with varying levels
of success. To identify the age and gender of several faces procedures, are followed by several methods. From the
neural network, features are taken by the convolution network. In light of the prepared models, the image is
processed into one of the age classes.

In our proposed method, we will use Open CV to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a
single image of a face. The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may
be one of the following ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100)
(8 nodes in the final soft max layer). It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image
because of factors like makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions. And so, we make this a
classification problem instead of making it one of regression. The software will detect faces, classify them
into male/female, classify it into one of eight age ranges and put the result on an image, and display it.
